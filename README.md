# Equivalent-dynamics-controller
The python code demonstrates a simple non-linear control law for an inverted pendulum using an idea called 'Equivalent dynamics'. The idea is the following; if one has the equations of motion for an [inverted pendulum with a control acceleration at the base] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum), and the equations of motion for the same mechanism with another set of forces that cause it to be stabe (i.e a normal [damped pendulum] (http://www2.phy.ilstu.edu/~rfm/380s13/chapters/CH2.4_Pendulum.pdf)), one can simply set them equal to each other and rearange to get the needed control acceleration to make the inverted pendulum act as a damped pendulum.

I wrote the python code to demonstrate that not only the idea works, but it also stable for a wider set of initial disturbed conditions compared to a simple PD controller. Another feature of this control law is that for [small angles] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_approximation) it is equivalent to a PD controller.
