# Equivalent-dynamics-controller
The python code demonstrates a simple non-linear control law for an inverted pendulum using an idea called 'Equivalent dynamics'. The idea is the following; if one has the equations of motion for an [inverted pendulum with a control acceleration at the base] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum), and the equations of motion for the same mechanism with another set of forces that cause it to be stabe (i.e a normal [damped pendulum] (http://www2.phy.ilstu.edu/~rfm/380s13/chapters/CH2.4_Pendulum.pdf)), one can simply set them equal to each other and rearrange to get the needed control acceleration to make the inverted pendulum act as a damped pendulum.

I wrote the python code to demonstrate that not only the idea works, but it also stable for a wider set of initial disturbed conditions compared to a simple PD controller. Another feature of this control law is that for [small angles] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_approximation) it is equivalent to a PD controller. The weights of the controller are found directly from the equivalent damped pendulum system, to give the required settling time.

The code uses a [costum Runge-Kutta solver] (https://github.com/sbillaudelle/runge-kutta) to solve the equations of motion in between the controller sampling times. After each iteration the pendulum angle is recorded with some normal noise and the controll acceleration is updated. The pendulum angular speed is estimated (for now) using a backward difference.
